Solutions to problems to the [foobar](http://www.google.com/foobar) easter egg page from Google.

I just started learning Python and this seems like a good opportunity.

## Requirements

-  [Python 2.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)
-  [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Feel free to make any suggestions or comments.

## Testing
Just run **nosetests** to execute tests in that directory recursively.
